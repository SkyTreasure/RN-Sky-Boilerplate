# React Native Boilerplate Code

I am creating this repo as from last couple of months i have created 4 apps, and spent almost 2 days on coniguring everything to start off with everything working in android and ios. So after getting advice from my friend i decided to create this repo to help me launch next app in record time.

I am an android developer, so i always end up with 3-4 days of dreadful effort to configure things to work on ios. So this repo i am creating with iOS first approach.
